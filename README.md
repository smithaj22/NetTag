Raspberry Pi Debugger for Microcontrollers

The team used a raspberry pi to connect with multiple target chips.  
The program written will find the chip being used on the target board through JTAG connections.
From there it will search the pre-loaded binaries and config files found in the boards folder and present that back to the user.
After the user selects which program they would like to flash or debug it will start.

See Presentation folder for more information on the scope of the project.
